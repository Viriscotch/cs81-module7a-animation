## What part of the code was most confusing and why?
The part of fake loading is confusing to me at first, as I was wondering what is actually loading since I conldn't find anything that could be loaded.

## How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
The animation is keep running without intervening any other behaviors.

## What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added a background color change when the animation is finished. It helps visualizing the completion of the process and makes it more interactive.
